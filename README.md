# VLSI_Systems


The following projects were developed on Altera Cyclone II FPGA and System Verilog their implementation. These projects are: <br />
* VGA protocol.
* ROM, projects an image on screen using ROM memory.
* PS2, uses PS2 protocol to read input from keyboard and changes image from ROM that is being projected on screen.
* EdgeDetector, detects edges that will be later used on ImageFilter.
* ImageFilter, uses erosion or dilation to filter the image and has an option to select which Kernel matrix to use (diamond or cross).
